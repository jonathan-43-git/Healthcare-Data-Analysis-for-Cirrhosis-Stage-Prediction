# Healthcare-Data-Analysis-for-Cirrhosis-Stage-Prediction

This Machine Learning project is a part of the course individual assignment, which aims to predict the stage of liver cirrhosis of 4 stages (Stage 1â€“4) based on patient demographic and laboratory test data. The dataset consist of 418 records which requires cleaning due to missing values, inconsistent entries, and outliers. The preprocessing steps included correcting mislabeled values, converting birth dates into age, dropping irrelevant columns, handling missing values, and scaling the numerical features.  

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was used to explore feature distributions and their relationship with each of the cirrhosis stages. Statistical tests such as Shapiro-Wilk and Kruskal-Wallis are used to support the analysis. I used Random Forest and XGBoost models for training and evaluation process, especially using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report, with XGBoost showing the best performance.  

This project highlights the importance of careful preprocessing and statistical analysis in healthcare prediction tasks, providing a structured workflow from raw clinical data into machine learning prediction results.
